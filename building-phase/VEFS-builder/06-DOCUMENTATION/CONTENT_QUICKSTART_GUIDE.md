## 📝 Content Writing Tips

### Writing Your Foundation Story

**Paragraph 1 - The Beginning:**
- Start with the problem you identified
- Describe the moment of inspiration
- Explain why you founded VEFS

Example:
> "In 2019, while visiting remote villages in Tamil Nadu, we noticed alarming deforestation and the disappearance of indigenous tree species. Local farmers were unaware of the economic and environmental value of native trees. This inspired us to establish VEFS Foundation to bridge this knowledge gap and revitalize our natural heritage."

**Paragraph 2 - Growth:**
- Describe key milestones
- Mention challenges overcome
- Highlight partnerships formed

**Paragraph 3 - Impact & Vision:**
- Share current achievements
- Describe communities served
- Paint a picture of the future

### Writing Your Mission Statement

**Formula:** What you do + Who you serve + How you do it + Why it matters

Example:
> "To conserve indigenous tree species through community-driven plantation programs, farmer training, and environmental education, empowering rural communities to create sustainable livelihoods while restoring ecological balance."

**Keep it:**
- Clear (easy to understand)
- Concise (1-2 sentences)
- Action-oriented (use verbs)
- Inspiring (shows impact)

### Writing Your Vision Statement

**Formula:** A future state + Beneficiaries + Ultimate outcome

Example:
> "A Tamil Nadu where indigenous forests thrive, communities prosper in harmony with nature, and future generations inherit a legacy of biodiversity and sustainable living."

**Keep it:**
- Aspirational (dream big)
- Future-focused (what you aspire to)
- Emotional (inspiring)
- Memorable (easy to recall)

### Writing Program Descriptions

**Short Description (1-2 sentences):**
- What is the program?
- Who is it for?

Example:
> "An interactive school program that teaches students about native trees, biodiversity, and sustainable living through hands-on activities and tree plantation drives."

**Full Description (2-3 paragraphs):**
- **Para 1:** What the program is and why it exists
- **Para 2:** What participants will do/learn
- **Para 3:** Impact and outcomes

- Start with what you have
- You can always update content later
- A good website launched is better than a perfect website delayed

### Tip 2: Use Placeholder Images Temporarily
- If you don't have professional photos yet, use what you have
- Free stock photos can work temporarily from:
  - Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/

### Tip 3: Get Help from Your Team
- Founder writes bio and foundation story
- Program coordinators write program descriptions
- Admin/secretary provides contact details and statistics

### Tip 4: Keep a Backup
- Save a copy of `CONTENT_TO_PROVIDE.md` on Google Drive or email
- Take photos/scans of important documents (registration, 80G cert)
- Keep image originals separate from optimized versions

### Tip 5: Think Mobile-First
- People will view on phones - keep descriptions concise
- Use bullet points instead of long paragraphs
- Check that images look good when cropped (for mobile view)

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: I don't have professional photos. What should I do?
**A:** Use the best photos you have (even smartphone photos). Ensure they're:
- Well-lit (natural daylight works best)
- In focus (not blurry)
- Properly cropped (centered subject)
- High resolution (at least 1200px wide)

You can replace with professional photos later.

### Q: I don't know our exact statistics (trees planted, farmers trained, etc.)
**A:** Provide your best estimates for now. You can update with exact numbers later. It's better to show approximate impact than no metrics at all.

### Q: We're still developing some programs. Should I include them?
**A:** Only include programs that are active or confirmed to launch soon. Mark future programs as "Coming Soon" if needed.

### Q: Can I update content after the website launches?
**A:** Yes! Content can be updated anytime. Text content requires editing HTML files. Programs/events can be updated by editing JSON files.

### Q: How do I get the Google Maps embed code?
**A:**
1. Go to https://maps.google.com
2. Search for your office address
3. Click "Share" button
4. Click "Embed a map" tab
5. Copy the iframe HTML code
6. Paste in Section 2 of `CONTENT_TO_PROVIDE.md`

### Q: Do I need to fill out EVERY section?
**A:** No! Focus on the critical sections first (marked with 🔴). The website works fine with partial content. Optional sections can be added later.
